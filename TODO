New version
-----------

* Update elftools/__init__.py
* Tag in git (v0.xx)

Preparing a new release
-----------------------

* Make sure new version was updated everywhere appropriate
* Run ``uv build`` or ``python3 -m build --sdist --wheel``
* Untar the created ``dist/pyelftools-x.y.tar.gz`` and make sure
  everything looks ok
* Distribute (see below)
* Tag new version in git
* Test with ``pip install`` from some new virtualenv

Distribution
------------

1. First install Twine (https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/)
   into a venv, unless already done in ~/bin/venv/...
2. Run ``uv publish`` or ``python3 -m twine upload dist/*``, but make sure
   package was already built and the updated whl and tarball are in dist/.

Credentials for PyPI are stored in ~/.pypirc

construct
---------

construct seems to be maintained again - they also backported my Python 3 fixes.
Theoretically, I can remove construct from pyelftools and use it as a dependency
instead. I don't really have time to play with this now, but may do so in the
future.
