class NameLUT(collections.Mapping):
    """ 
    A "Name LUT" holds any of the tables specified by .debug_pubtypes or
    .debug_pubnames sections. This is basically a dictionary where the key is
    the symbol name (either a public variable, function or a type), and the
    value is the tuple (cu_offset, die_offset) corresponding to the variable.
    The die_offset is an absolute offset (meaning, it can be used to search the
    CU by iterating until a match is obtained).

    An ordered dictionary is used to preserve the CU order (i.e, items are
    stored on a per-CU basis (as it was originally in the .debug_* section).

    Usage:

    The NameLUT walks and talks like a dictionary and hence it can be used as
    such. Some examples below:

    # get the pubnames (a NameLUT from DWARF info).
    pubnames = dwarf_info.get_pubnames()

    # lookup a variable.
    entry1 = pubnames["var_name1"]
    entry2 = pubnames.get("var_name2", default=<default_var>)
    print(entry2.cu_ofs)
    ...

    # iterate over items.
    for (name, entry) in pubnames.items():
      # do stuff with name, entry.cu_ofs, entry.die_ofs

    # iterate over items on a per-CU basis.
    import itertools
    for cu_ofs, item_list in itertools.groupby(pubnames.items(), 
        key = lambda x: x[1].cu_ofs):
      # items are now grouped by cu_ofs.
      # item_list is an iterator yeilding NameLUTEntry'ies belonging 
      # to cu_ofs.
      # We can parse the CU at cu_offset and use the parsed CU results
      # to parse the pubname DIEs in the CU listed by item_list.
      for item in item_list:
        # work with item which is part of the CU with cu_ofs.
