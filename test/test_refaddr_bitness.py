# The error that motivated this fix was in an iOS binary in Mach-O format. It
# had v2 DWARF data, but it was targeting a 64 bit architecture. Before the fix,
# pyelftools would assume that DW_FORM_ref_addr attribute took 4 bytes and
# misparse the DWARF data in the binary.
#
# Since pyelftools doesn't work with Mach-O files, I've taken a sample binary
# apart, and saved the three relevant sections - info, abbrev, and str as flat
# files. The metadata (the fact that it's targeting ARM64) is hard-coded, since
# the Mach-O header isn't preserved.
